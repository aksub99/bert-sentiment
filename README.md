# Description

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of `BERT` to extract the portion of a tweet that represents it's sentiment. The code makes use of the `huggingface` library for pretrained versions of the `BERT` model.

`sentiment-bert.ipynb` contains the implementation and results. The data and problem description can be found in the Kaggle competition `Tweet Sentiment Extraction`.

For a detailed walk-through of this code, please view my blog post at
